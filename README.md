Test-Driven Development (TDD)
This project utilizes Test-Driven Development (TDD) to create all core functionality, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the application from the ground up. By writing tests before implementing each feature, we can guarantee that the functionality behaves as expected and meets predefined requirements. This approach is particularly beneficial for "NetworkScanner" since it allows for experimentation with different types of implementations while maintaining confidence that no existing functionality will break.

Using TDD, we are able to:

Catch Errors Early: By verifying code against tests at every stage, we identify potential issues during development, reducing bugs in production.
Enable Refactoring: With comprehensive test coverage, we can refactor code and experiment with optimizations or alternative methods, knowing that any deviations from expected behavior will be immediately flagged.
Enhance Code Quality: Writing tests helps clarify requirements and promotes modular, testable code, resulting in a cleaner, more maintainable codebase.
Document Expected Behavior: Tests serve as documentation, providing insights into each component's expected inputs, outputs, and interactions.
This disciplined approach allows for reliable, continuous development and enables us to scale the project with confidence.
